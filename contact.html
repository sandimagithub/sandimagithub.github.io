			Hi!  My name is Sandi and this is my sample website.
			I'm currently unemployed and have been slowly re-training to become a web developer.  It's been a long process because I've been taking a number of classes from various programs, but coding requires a more discliplined and in-depth, continuous form of study.  That's why I'm apply for this bootcamp at General Assembly.
